# california_stats

A small script written with Python 2.7 to demonstrate how to read data about entities, in this case cities in California, from disparate data sources and combine and output that data. I've just been running `python california_population.py` from the root of this project's directory on my Mac.

I am in no way implying this is good or reasonable code
